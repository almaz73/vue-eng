        A professional working in the field of logistics management is called a logistician. The main functions of a qualified logistician include, among other things, inventory management, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, consultation and organizing and planning of these activities. Logisticians are responsible for the life cycle and supply chain operations of a variety of products. They are also responsible for customs documentation. They regularly work with other departments to ensure that the customers’ needs and requirements are met. Logisticians work in nearly every industry. Most logisticians work for either large shipping firms or international distribution companies. This career experienced a rapid growth in the mid-1980s as manufacturing firms shifted to just in time delivery. As a result of this change, it was necessary to schedule and manage the movement of large volumes of materials all over the world. This career has continued to grow, with the enhancement of computer technology that allows more firms to take advantage of this cost-reduction measure. Managing the supply chain is the top priority for a logistician. The supply chain refers to every step in the process from the procurement of materials to the production and shipment of those materials to different locations.
